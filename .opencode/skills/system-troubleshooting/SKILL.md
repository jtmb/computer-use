# System Troubleshooting

Find the failing layer before changing the system.

## Procedure

1. Restate the observable symptom and reproduce it when safe.
2. Gather narrow read-only evidence: versions, process state, resource use,
service status, relevant journal lines, device visibility, configuration,
and free space. Do not collect unrelated private logs.
3. Form one testable cause. Distinguish application, session, permission,
service, package, hardware, and network layers.
4. Apply the smallest reversible fix after any needed approval.
If it needs administrator authentication in GNOME, run only that bounded
command through `pkexec` and let the user complete the trusted PolicyKit
dialog. Do not observe or control the desktop until authentication completes.
5. Repeat the same reproduction and add one regression check.
6. Record what changed, evidence of success, rollback, and residual risk.

## Safety

- Ask before reboot/logout, package removal, firewall changes, permission/group
changes, deleting data, killing unrelated work, or changing security controls.
- Never disable AppArmor, Secure Boot, browser sandboxing, TLS validation,
or Wayland security as a shortcut.
- Never use `chmod 777`, world-writable device rules, blanket process kills,
`git reset --hard`, or broad cache/config deletion without a proven cause.
- Redact credentials and private content from logs and reports.
- Never request, read, relay, or type an administrator password. Verify the
  repaired system state after the user-controlled PolicyKit prompt closes.
- If hardware safety, data loss, or filesystem corruption is plausible, stop
  writes and prioritize backup/integrity checks.

## Usage guide

When the user asks how to use this skill, also read
[README.md](./README.md) for request examples, prerequisites, verification,
and safety requirements.
