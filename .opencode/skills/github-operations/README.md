# GitHub Operations Usage

This guide explains how to use the `github-operations` skill. The agent-facing
rules remain in [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md); OpenCode does not automatically load
this usage guide when the skill is loaded.

Category: `applications`

Tags: `github`, `mcp`, `repositories`, `issues`, `pull-requests`, `automation`

## Purpose and when to use it

Use `github-operations` to inspect GitHub repositories, code, issues, pull
requests, checks, or releases, and to prepare or perform explicitly approved
remote changes.

Appropriate requests include:

- "Summarize the open issues in this GitHub repository."
- "Review pull request 42 and report blocking concerns."
- "Check why the latest GitHub Actions run failed."
- "Create a draft pull request from this branch after showing me the diff."

## Prerequisites and setup verification

The repository setup installs the pinned official GitHub MCP Server below the
selected profile and registers the canonical local wrapper. Authenticate the
GitHub CLI yourself with `gh auth login --hostname github.com`. At server start,
the wrapper obtains a transient token from that saved login and passes it only
in the child environment. Do not paste a token into `opencode.json`, a
repository file, chat, logs, or task memory.

The agent can verify installation and connection without displaying a token:

```bash
opencode mcp list
```

The local MCP must report `connected`; `needs_auth` and `failed` are not
accepted results.

## How to request it

Ask in ordinary language and name the exact repository or GitHub URL whenever
possible.

Example requests:

- "Use GitHub to list open pull requests in owner/repository."
- "Compare issue 17 with the current implementation."
- "Show me the failed checks on this pull request."
- "Prepare an issue comment, but do not publish it."

Read-only requests normally use MCP tools. Mutations also use MCP tools now
that the wrapper enables write toolsets, but only after the agent inspects the
target and asks immediately before the action. The authenticated `gh` CLI
remains the fallback for functionality the MCP does not cover.

## Worked workflow and expected result

A representative pull-request inspection is:

1. Confirm the owner, repository, and pull request number.
2. Read pull request metadata, changed files, commits, and relevant checks.
3. Inspect only the repository content needed to assess the change.
4. Report findings by severity with canonical GitHub links.
5. Leave reviews, comments, labels, merge state, and branches unchanged.

For a requested remote mutation, the agent first presents the exact target and
content, asks immediately before the final action, performs it once after
confirmation, and re-reads the resulting remote object.

Expected result: the user receives verified GitHub state or one specifically
approved remote change plus its canonical URL.

## Verification and known limitations

The default MCP surface is restricted to `context`, `repos`, `issues`,
`pull_requests`, `actions`, and `users`, with lockdown mode enabled. Write
operations are enabled so mutations are MCP tool calls behind the confirmation
gate. The bounded toolset list keeps context size and blast radius controlled
and filters some untrusted public issue content.

Known limitations:

- The wrapper resolves its credential when the MCP starts; running sessions do
  not reload the saved `gh` login or MCP configuration, so restart OpenCode
  after changing authentication.
- Read-only mode does not reduce the token's underlying account permissions.
- Lockdown mode is a best-effort content filter, not a security boundary.
- GitHub Actions, releases, discussions, projects, and security toolsets are not
  exposed by the default MCP wrapper; the agent may use `gh` when requested.
- Organization SSO and policy can restrict an otherwise valid credential.

## Troubleshooting

- MCP says authentication is not configured: the operator checks `gh auth
  status --hostname github.com` or runs `gh auth login` outside the agent, then
  restarts OpenCode. Never add a token or header to the config.
- `401` or `403`: check token expiration, selected repositories, permissions,
  organization SSO authorization, and organization MCP policy without printing
  the token.
- Tools are missing: verify the request belongs to one of the six configured
  toolsets. Widening the list is a deliberate change that needs explicit
  approval.
- Repository content is hidden: lockdown mode may filter public contributions
  from users without push access.
- Mutation is available through the MCP, but only after the agent inspects the
  target and asks immediately before the action; use `gh` only for
  functionality the MCP does not cover.

## Safety, confirmation, and elevation

Authentication, token creation, SSO authorization, OAuth/App authorization, and
permission changes require the user's participation and immediate approval.
The agent never asks for, displays, types, logs, or stores the credential; the
wrapper alone reads it from the authenticated `gh` session at process start.

The agent also asks immediately before publishing or sending GitHub content,
merging, pushing, triggering deployments or workflows, deleting remote data, or
changing repository/account/security settings. Local installation is
user-owned and needs no administrator elevation.
