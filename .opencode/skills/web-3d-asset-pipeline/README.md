# Web 3D Asset Pipeline Usage

This guide explains how to request `web-3d-asset-pipeline`. Agent operating
rules remain in [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md). OpenCode loads `SKILL.md` on demand;
this README, provenance, and license are not loaded automatically.

## Purpose and when to use it

Use this skill to turn an editable 3D source into a predictable browser asset,
or to diagnose a GLB/glTF that loads with the wrong scale, pivot, hierarchy,
materials, textures, animation, collision, or performance characteristics. It
owns the asset pipeline, not engine selection or runtime scene architecture.

The workflow is adapted from OpenAI's public Game Studio guidance for this
repository's Ubuntu, Blender, file-safety, and browser UIA tools. See
[PROVENANCE.md](./PROVENANCE.md) and [LICENSE.txt](./LICENSE.txt).

## Prerequisites and setup verification

The agent checks, without installing anything:

- the exact source and current runtime asset paths
- the target engine/loader and its existing package lockfile
- the project's asset conventions and budgets
- the installed DCC/exporter version when a DCC is needed
- the `browser-assistant` `wsl_browser_*` UIA tools for visible work from WSL,
  using the Windows default browser, an explicit window ID, and fresh preview
  tokens for supported mutations
- the pinned isolated Firefox runtime only when headless validation was
  explicitly requested
- any existing, approved, pinned optimization command

There is no assumed Blender MCP server. If Blender is used, the agent loads the
[`blender` skill](../blender/SKILL.md) and verifies Blender's executable and
version. Missing Node tools are not force-installed, and `npx` is not used to
download undeclared packages.

## How to request it

- "Prepare this Blender prop for Three.js as a GLB and preserve the source."
- "Find why this model imports at the wrong scale and rotates around the wrong
  point."
- "Reduce this GLB if our existing toolchain supports it, then verify it in my
  Windows default browser from WSL."
- "Check the hierarchy, materials, textures, animation names, and runtime load
  of this glTF."

Name the source, target project or loader, output location, quality constraints,
and required animation, collision, or LOD behavior.

## Worked workflow and expected result

A representative GLB delivery proceeds as follows:

1. Record units, orientation, pivot, stable names, hierarchy, materials,
   textures, animations, collisions, LODs, and size budget.
2. Inventory and preserve the source files and existing shipping asset.
3. Clean only the necessary scene data and export a new versioned GLB.
4. Reimport it into a clean scene and compare structure and transforms.
5. Run the project's existing local server on loopback and load the exact GLB
   in the user's Windows default browser through the WSL browser UIA tools.
6. Take an accessibility snapshot and a screenshot of the canvas/WebGL result.
   Inspect console and network activity only when an approved tool exposes it;
   if diagnostics are unavailable, record a blocker rather than claiming a
   clean console or network.
7. Report measured size and load behavior plus structural and visual findings.

Expected result: a new runtime asset that meets the explicit contract, reimports
without unexpected loss, and loads visibly in the Windows default browser. A
clean console/network result is claimable only when an approved tool exposes
those diagnostics; otherwise report the blocker and leave that check incomplete.
These are documented representative steps; they were not executed while
creating the skill.

## Verification and known limitations

- Export must be followed by clean reimport and structural comparison.
- Browser verification must load the exact shipping file through the actual
  project loader, not a DCC preview. Visible WSL work uses the Windows-default-
  browser UIA connector; isolated headless Firefox requires an explicit request.
- A browser accessibility snapshot does not describe canvas geometry;
  screenshot inspection is mandatory for WebGL output. If the approved UIA
  tools cannot expose the required screenshot or interaction, report validation
  as incomplete and do not fall back to desktop input or Chrome/Chromium.
- UIA does not guarantee console or network-diagnostic access. If a required
  console/network check cannot be made through an approved tool, report the
  limitation as a blocker; do not claim that UIA exposes browser diagnostics.
- A desktop/mobile viewport pass does not replace testing on real mobile GPU,
  memory, touch input, and network conditions.
- Compression is tested only when a compatible approved tool and decoder
  already exist.
- Reimport may normalize representation while retaining appearance, so compare
  against the runtime contract rather than requiring byte-identical data.

## Troubleshooting

- Wrong scale/orientation: compare source units, exporter conversion, root and
  child transforms, and runtime loader transforms before editing geometry.
- Wrong pivot: inspect the authored origin and parent hierarchy; do not hide a
  reusable asset error with per-instance runtime offsets unless intentional.
- Missing or flat materials: inspect supported PBR nodes, texture existence,
  color spaces, UV sets, alpha mode, and browser requests.
- Renamed nodes or clips: stabilize source names and exporter settings, then
  reimport and compare before changing runtime selectors.
- GLB works locally but not through the app: inspect exact URL, status, MIME,
  CORS, base path, decoder availability, and console error when those
  diagnostics are exposed; otherwise leave that part of the validation blocked.
- Optimized asset fails: restore the preserved baseline, identify the one
  incompatible optimization, and do not stack speculative recompression.

## Safety, confirmation, and elevation

The agent preserves sources and prior shipping assets, writes unused versioned
outputs, previews batch path changes, and asks before deletion or replacement.
It never uploads an asset without an exact file and destination from the user.
It does not install add-ons, Node packages, decoders, repositories, or system
packages implicitly. Blender and browser applications are never run as root,
and security controls are not weakened.
