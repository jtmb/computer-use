# Game Playtest Usage

This guide explains how to request `game-playtest`. Agent operating rules
remain in [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md). OpenCode loads `SKILL.md` on demand; this
README, provenance, and license are not loaded automatically.

Category: `browser`

Tags: `games`, `playtesting`, `playwright`, `canvas`, `webgl`

The `playwright` tag refers only to the explicitly requested isolated headless
Firefox runtime; visible browser work uses the Windows-default-browser UIA path.

## Purpose and when to use it

Use this skill for browser-game smoke tests, gameplay QA, canvas/WebGL visual
checks, HUD and overlay review, responsive sanity checks, console-error review,
and reproducible bug reports. Visible authenticated browser work from WSL uses
the Windows-default-browser UIA tools documented by `browser-assistant`; isolated
headless Firefox is reserved for requests that explicitly ask for it. The skill
verifies player-visible postconditions rather than assuming an input worked.

The workflow is adapted from OpenAI's public Game Studio playtest concepts for
this repository. See [PROVENANCE.md](./PROVENANCE.md) and
[LICENSE.txt](./LICENSE.txt).

## Prerequisites and setup verification

The agent checks:

- the exact game URL and build/commit under test
- documented controls, main verbs, and expected states
- the project's existing start command and lockfile for local games
- the `browser-assistant` `wsl_browser_*` tools for visible work from WSL, with
  an explicit window ID and fresh preview token for each supported mutation
- the pinned isolated Firefox runtime only when headless mode was explicitly
  requested

No package, browser extension, profiler, or dependency is installed merely to
start a playtest. A temporary local server stays on loopback unless network
exposure was explicitly requested. Visible work uses the user's configured
Windows default browser and authenticated session through UIA; do not switch to
Chrome/Chromium, desktop-control, or coordinate input if the connector is
unavailable. Stop and report a blocker instead.

## How to request it

- "Smoke-test this browser game in my Windows default browser from WSL."
- "Exercise movement, jump, attack, pause, and restart, then report bugs by
  severity."
- "Check the WebGL scene and HUD at desktop and mobile viewport sizes."
- "Run this playtest headlessly and call out what cannot be trusted without a
  visible session."
- "Let me handle pointer lock, then continue after I hand control back."

Include the URL or project, expected controls, important game states, target
viewports, and any prohibited state-changing actions.

## Worked workflow and expected result

A representative visible-browser smoke test from WSL is:

1. Start the existing project command on loopback if needed.
2. Inspect an accessibility snapshot from the explicit browser window before input.
3. Check boot console messages and failed asset requests only if an approved
   `wsl_browser_*` tool exposes them; otherwise record the diagnostics blocker.
4. Inspect a mandatory screenshot of the canvas/WebGL initial state through the
   approved browser tools; if unavailable, stop without claiming visual QA.
5. Focus the identified game surface and send one bounded input for each main
   verb.
6. After each action, inspect fresh semantic state and a fresh screenshot.
7. Exercise normal play, pause/overlay, failure or success, and desktop/mobile
   resize states relevant to the game.
8. Recheck console errors, delete all screenshots, and produce a severity-first
   text report with exact reproduction steps and testing gaps.

Expected result: a reproducible assessment of boot, input, rendering, HUD, and
responsive behavior with no retained screenshot files. A clean console/network
result is claimable only when an approved tool actually exposes those
diagnostics; otherwise the report records the blocker and incomplete check.
These are documented representative steps; they were not executed while
creating the skill.

## Verification and known limitations

- Accessibility is inspected first, but canvas/WebGL always requires visual
  screenshot inspection.
- The DOM can expose the canvas element and surrounding HUD; it cannot prove or
  directly drive the internal rendered scene.
- Each input is verified against a post-state or visible frame change.
- Console and network evidence is required at boot and after exercised states.
  UIA does not guarantee access to browser diagnostics: do not claim it exposes
  console errors, and treat missing diagnostics as a blocker/incomplete check.
- Resizing the browser to a narrow viewport, when the approved UIA tools support
  and expose that operation, does not emulate every touch, safe-area, GPU,
  memory, power, or network characteristic of a phone.
- Pointer lock, gamepad, multitouch, timing-sensitive combinations, multiplayer,
  and long-session performance may need user or device testing.
- Headless and visible rendering or timing can differ; the report identifies
  which mode was used.

## Troubleshooting

- Blank canvas: inspect load indicators, console exceptions, failed GLB/texture
  or shader requests, renderer fallback, and canvas dimensions.
- Input has no effect: refresh the snapshot, verify focus and overlays, click
  the identified canvas once, send one documented key, and inspect post-state.
- Canvas has no accessible children: expected; use bounded input and screenshot
  evidence rather than DOM selectors for scene objects.
- Stale element reference: take a fresh snapshot after navigation, resize, or
  user takeover.
- Pointer lock or gesture cannot be automated reliably: use bounded user
  takeover, then inspect fresh state after handoff.
- WSL browser UIA tools unavailable: stop and report a visible-browser blocker.
  Do not inspect Playwright MCP registration or fall back to Chrome/Chromium,
  GNOME desktop-control, or coordinate clicking. For explicitly requested
  headless mode only, verify the pinned Firefox runtime.
- Nondeterministic animation or physics: use a known deterministic test surface
  if the project already provides one, otherwise report frequency and evidence
  without claiming certainty.

## Safety, confirmation, and elevation

The agent asks before publishing chat, scores, levels, or other content;
purchasing; accepting legal terms; deleting cloud saves; resetting account
progress; or changing account/security/privacy settings. It never handles
passwords, MFA, payment details, or CAPTCHAs. Local files are not uploaded and
servers are not exposed beyond loopback without explicit scope. No elevation is
needed for ordinary playtesting, and browser security controls are not weakened.

Every screenshot taken for playtest analysis is deleted immediately after
inspection. The retained output is a text report.
