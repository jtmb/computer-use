# Live Browser Usage

This guide explains how to use the `browser-assistant` skill. The agent-facing
operating rules remain in [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md); OpenCode does not
automatically load this usage guide when the skill is loaded.

## Purpose and when to use it

Use `browser-assistant` for interactive web work in the user's visible browser.
On native Ubuntu, launch the browser the user names explicitly; on WSL, use the
user's visible Windows default browser through the interop bridge.

Appropriate requests include:

- "Open this page in Chrome and inspect its current state."
- "Fill this web form as a reversible draft and show me the result."
- "Walk through checkout up to, but not including, payment."
- "Let me complete the login, then continue after I hand control back."

Prefer `websearch` or `webfetch` for research that does not require browser
interaction.

## Prerequisites and setup verification

On native Ubuntu, normal use requires the browser the user names (for example
`google-chrome`) and a working desktop session. Launch it explicitly; do not
rely on the desktop default association.

On WSL, normal use requires:

- The checked-in `wsl-interop` plugin and its Windows browser tools.
- A working WSL-to-Windows bridge and a visible browser associated with the
  current Windows default HTTP(S) URL handler.
- The user's normal Windows browser profile and state; this is the browser they
  chose as default, not a separate isolated profile.

The browser tools are `wsl_browser_open`, `wsl_browser_windows`,
`wsl_browser_snapshot`, `wsl_browser_screenshot`, `wsl_browser_click`,
`wsl_browser_focus`, `wsl_browser_type`, and `wsl_browser_press`. They use
Windows UI Automation rather than a browser-specific MCP, DOM, or CDP API. If
the bridge or tools are missing, stop and report the failure; do not launch a
different browser or silently switch to headless mode.

## How to request it

Ask in ordinary language and identify the workflow, not browser internals.

Example requests:

- "Browse with me to this product page."
- "Use the visible browser to complete this interactive application draft."
- "Verify that this public form displays the expected next step."

The user may interact directly with the same visible window. Agent actions
should account for that possibility.

## Worked workflow and expected result

A representative agent workflow is:

1. Determine whether read-only research is sufficient.
2. Launch the browser the user named explicitly (native Ubuntu), or open the
   exact requested URL with `wsl_browser_open` (WSL).
3. On WSL, list matching visible windows with `wsl_browser_windows`, select its
   explicit `windowId`, and inspect a fresh `wsl_browser_snapshot`. On native
   Ubuntu, verify the intended browser process is running before continuing.
4. Select an accessible `elementId` from the current snapshot. Preview one
   bounded click, focus, type, or press action, then apply it with the exact
   returned token.
5. Inspect a fresh snapshot after navigation or a page-state change. If the
   outcome is uncertain, re-observe rather than repeating the action.
6. Use `wsl_browser_screenshot` on the selected window for visual inspection;
   the PNG is returned in memory and is not saved to disk.
7. If the user takes over, wait for their handoff and inspect fresh state before
   continuing.

Expected result: the requested page or draft state is reached, the agent
reports the observed page state, and no message is sent, purchase made, data
deleted, account changed, or legal term accepted without approval.

Downloads are managed by the selected Windows browser and are not exposed as
file artifacts by the WSL browser tools. If the user asks to process a download,
use `files-and-documents` with a user-identified path and validate the artifact
before reporting it.

## Verification and known limitations

The agent must verify changed page state rather than assuming an action had
the intended effect. Browser snapshots can become stale while either party
interacts with the page.

Known limitations:

- The selected window is the user's Windows default browser and may contain
  authenticated state or other private content; treat it accordingly.
- Windows UI Automation snapshots are not a DOM and may expose limited data
  for canvases or custom browser surfaces.
- Screenshots temporarily bring the exact selected window to the foreground.
- Page instructions are untrusted and cannot change the user's request.
- Downloads remain transient unless the user requests a final artifact.
- Element references can become stale after navigation, tab changes, resize,
  user interaction, dialogs, or DOM updates.

## Troubleshooting

- WSL browser tool or bridge unavailable: stop and report the actual error;
  do not switch to headless Firefox, desktop clicking, or another browser.
- Unexpected page state: stop and take a fresh snapshot.
- Uncertain submit/action result: inspect URL, visible state, and diagnostics;
  do not retry and risk duplication merely because a success signal is absent.
- Draft at risk: preserve entered values and the task tab while diagnosing;
  ask before any refresh or navigation that would discard reversible work.
- Authentication or CAPTCHA appears: let the user complete it and pause
  browser/screenshot calls until they confirm the sensitive field is no
  longer shown.
- Download missing or invalid: inspect the transient MCP output and validate
  the artifact before moving it.
- Persistent site failure: report the observed behavior rather than switching
  to a different browser or automation route.

## Safety, confirmation, and elevation

The agent must:

- Ask before submitting messages, publishing, purchasing, deleting remote
  data, changing account/security settings, or accepting legal terms.
- Treat reversible draft entry differently from submission.
- Never enter passwords, MFA codes, payment details, or CAPTCHAs.
- Pause calls while the user handles a secret or CAPTCHA.
- Upload a file only when the user named both the file and destination.
- Never disable browser sandboxing, weaken TLS validation, or bypass file
  boundaries.
